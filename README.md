# MyFirst
My first repository
The GitHub web interface allows you to edit content (add and delete as well) online. I recommend this to mostly quick items. To edit, select the file and then click on the ✏️ icon in the title pane for the file. Once you are done editing, you must commit the changes you’ve made (and put in good description of what you did).
